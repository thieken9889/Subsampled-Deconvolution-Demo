# Subsampled-Deconvolution-Demo
Demo code for subsampled blind deconvolution. This is part of my MS thesis, and some preliminary versions were written as part of my [undergraduate research thesis](https://kb.osu.edu/handle/1811/91630). 

# Pre-Requisites
Users will need an version of MATLAB. This code is known to work in versions from 2018-2020. Users will also need to install [TFOCS](http://cvxr.com/tfocs/), which only involves downloading then adding folders to one's MATLAB directory.

# Organization
There is only one script to run, BlindDeconv_2D_demo.m. The rest of the functions are organized in /src. Often, the functions reference different equations that are not written in the code. I want to add a document with those different mathematical expressions to this repository.
